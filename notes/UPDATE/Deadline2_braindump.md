recent prompt:

I think we've got excellent real-time synchronization and no visible lag. I think we're doing alright on conflict resolution. No ghost objects, rapid edits. We need to add visual feedback on who last edited, and probably also make sure that we have clear indication of who owns an object, so when one person selects the object, or at least is mutating it, that it's visible on the other person. We might have that, but yeah, it needs another look. These are a fresh as mid-edit. Should return to the last known state. Mid-drag, I believe, would be ideal. We have all users disconnect. We have the network drop. Autoreconnects are complete state. We need to add the operations during disconnect queue and sync on reconnect. I don't think that we have that, but we need to add a queue for that. We also need to add a UI to show connection status. Pan and zoom is pretty smooth. We need to add some additional shapes. Let's add stars, triangles, pentagons, hexagons. We need to add multi-select. We need to add text formatting, bold, italicized, underline, and also be able to adjust the size of the text. I'm not sure that we can right now. We need to add layer management, be able to move things to the front or the back. We need to be able to duplicate these additional operations. Only to add operations as well as functions so that the AI can do that easily. We need to add some puppeteer performance tests where we add a thousand, two thousand objects and measure that performance is still great across ideally multiple users. Let's add a palette feature. Right now we show the most recent colors and we can add favorites, but let's just add the ability to create a palette which has five colors associated together. Let's add keyboard shortcuts for duplicate and the ability to use the arrow keys to move an object. Let's also add the ability to group or ungroup objects. So when they're a group, we can easily click a button on the sidebar to select a group and then move that group. And then also apply AI commands to that group. We should also add an AI tool, the ability to describe an object by its characteristics. And then visually show that we've selected that group and then not allow us to apply a transform to that group. So what I mean is we can say select all the purple ones or all the squares. So there will need to be some AI here to be able to evaluate the right filters among the criteria, especially for a complex thing of all the small squares, all the pink circles when there might be different shades of pink. So there will be some vagueness that we need to maybe use the AI to interprI also add selection tools. These are related. Lasso Select and Select All of a Type. The All of a Type already fits into what we said. It's kind of a more specific case. The Lasso Tool is a known algorithm and should be straightforward to add.et, but then it can use the known characteristics and determine the right set of filters to select that group. We need to document the specific AI commands that we have available. Make sure that they include all of the ones directly below. And then we need to come up with a set of test AI commands that test variations and combinations of those commands. Test cases, maybe 20 to 30 core things that we want to test, and then five variations of each. And then we can run tests on all of those and make sure that our tools work with that.  // added this plus the rubric plus my codebase in gemini-2.5-pro and asked for 3 feature prds grouped by theme / code section. Asked grok 4 the same thing. Grok's output was more succinct so i took that to gemeni and asked: "I had another day I looked at the same thing and come up with some recommendations. See below. I want to make sure though, especially on those tier, multi-tier 1, 2, and 3, that we're not just trying to throw the kitchen sink at it and get bad features. I want really smooth design and solid features, like a really well-architected system. Also use the ones that I described probably as the guideline, but I want to also identify areas where we can really polish the experience and help maybe identify one or two key user stories and add something really nice for them to be able to work with." THen took the revised ones from gemeni back to grok, no additional prompting at all, and it came out with an analysis of strengths and some suggestions for improvements. I liked it, it was moving away from the kitchen sink approach. Took it's recommendations back to gemini, adding "// Please incorporate this feedback, you need the very best PRDs. Also, eliminate all the timelines. That's not helpful, manage that separately."

Then, i take each of those 3 PRDs, have task-master parse them, 10 tasks each (using grok-code-fast-1). Then i ask claude to review them while i also review them (using https://www.npmjs.com/package/tm-view, something i had claude whip up on Wednesday), make any high level edits, the analyze complexity and expand using task master. Then, currently, i have 3 background agents running in Cursor, one for each PRD, that are working on the tasks.
