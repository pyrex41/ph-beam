## Architecture Evolution

### From Fabric.js to PixiJS v8 (October 15)

The frontend underwent a **complete rendering engine migration** documented in PR #2:

**Before (Fabric.js):**
- CPU-based canvas rendering
- Single object selection
- Monolithic LiveView hook
- Limited performance at scale

**After (PixiJS v8):**
- **WebGL-accelerated rendering** - Hardware acceleration
- **Viewport culling** - Only render visible objects (100px padding)
- **Render groups** - Batch draw calls for performance
- **Multi-selection** - Shift+click support
- **Shared resources** - Reuse TextStyle/GraphicsContext across cursors
- **CanvasManager extraction** - Standalone class (84% code reduction in hook!)

**Performance Impact:**
- Network traffic: 95% reduction during interactions
- FPS monitoring: Built-in performance tracking
- Scalability: Handles 100+ objects smoothly
- Latency: <100ms for most operations

### AI System Evolution

**Phase 1 (Early October):** Basic AI integration
- 7 simple tools (create_shape, create_text, move, resize, delete, group)
- Single object operations
- Hardcoded component builders (5 types)
- Hardcoded themes (4 color schemes)

**Phase 2 (October 16 - PRD 3.0):** Intelligent design system
- **15+ AI tools** including layouts
- **Multi-object operations** with selection context
- **Component system** with templates and instances
- **Database-driven styles** with export
- **Natural language layouts** ("arrange in a circle")
- **Property modification** (rotate, opacity, styles)

**Phase 3 (October 17 - PR #3):** Performance optimization
- **Command classifier** - Route simple/complex commands
- **Multi-provider support** - Groq (fast) + Claude (complex)
- **Circuit breaker** - Fault tolerance
- **Rate limiting** - API protection
- **Health monitoring** - Provider status tracking

**Projected gains from PR #3:**
- 60% of commands under 1 second (vs 2.8s average)
- 58% cost savings on LLM API calls
- Sub-500ms latency for simple commands via Groq

### Database Schema Evolution

**Initial (Early October):**
```
users → canvases → objects
```

**After PRD 3.0 (October 16):**
```
users → canvases → objects ←─┐
                ↓             │
         components ←─────────┘
         styles
         canvas_user_viewports
         user_color_preferences
```

**Total migrations:** 8
- Initial: users, canvases, objects
- Locking: locked_by field
- PRD 3.0: components, styles, component_fields
- Color picker: viewports, color_preferences

## Code Quality & Testing Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development

The project demonstrates exceptional test discipline:

**Context Modules (Backend):**
- Components: 31/31 tests (100%)
- Styles: 42/42 tests (100%)
- AI Layouts: 29/29 tests (100%)
- AI Commands: 47/47 tests (100%)
- Canvases: 40/40 tests (100%)
- Accounts: 9/9 tests (100%)

**LiveComponents (Frontend):**
- Components Panel: 23/23 tests (100%)
- Styles Panel: 23/23 tests (100%)

**Total Production-Critical Coverage:** 172/172 tests passing (100%)

### Performance-First Design

Every major feature has **measurable performance targets** documented in PRD3_COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION.md:

| Operation | Target | Measured | Status |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| AI Response | <2s | 1.5-2s avg | ✅ |
| Component Update | <100ms | 50-80ms | ✅ |
| Style Application | <50ms | 20-40ms | ✅ |
| Layout (50 objects) | <500ms | 300-450ms | ✅ |
| PubSub Broadcast | <50ms | 10-30ms | ✅ |

### Real-Time Collaboration Architecture

**PubSub Topics:**
- `canvas:<canvas_id>` - Object updates
- `component:<event>` - Component events
- `styles:<event>` - Style events

**Presence Tracking:**
- User cursors with position tracking
- User colors and metadata

## Development Workflow Insights

### Task Master AI Integration

The `.taskmaster/` directory reveals sophisticated AI-assisted development:

**Configuration:**
- `config.json` - AI model configuration
- `state.json` - Current workflow state
- `tasks/tasks.json` - 443 lines of structured tasks

**Documentation:**
- PRD files (core, copilot, workflow)
- Complexity reports (JSON)
- Task workflow files (10 files)

**Process:**
1. Parse PRD → Generate tasks
2. Analyze complexity → Expand tasks
3. Track implementation → Update status
4. Validate completion → Mark done

### Parallel Development Strategy

PR #2 documentation reveals **8 concurrent sub-agents** working simultaneously:

**Phase 1 Agents (Backend):**
- Agent 1: Database schema
- Agent 2: Components context
- Agent 3: AI layouts
- Agent 4: Styles context

**Phase 2 Agents (Frontend):**
- Agent 5: Components panel
- Agent 6: Styles panel
- Agent 7: AI layouts frontend
- Agent 8: AI commands frontend

This parallelization enabled **10 major tasks completed in a single day** (October 16).

## Technical Debt & Future Work

### Identified Gaps (from PRD3 docs)

**Before October 16:**
1. ❌ No instance system (components were one-time generated)
2. ❌ No multi-select (only single object selection)
3. ❌ No layout algorithms (no distribute/align)
4. ❌ No design token database (colors hardcoded)
5. ❌ No rotation/transform support
6. ❌ Limited AI tools (only 7 basic operations)

**After October 16:**
1. ✅ Full component instance system with overrides
2. ✅ Multi-selection with Shift+click
3. ✅ 5 layout algorithms (horizontal, vertical, grid, circular, align)
4. ✅ Design token database with 4-format export
5. ✅ Rotation support with pivot points
6. ✅ 15+ AI tools including property modifications

### Remaining Work (from docs)

**Non-Critical Test Failures (66 tests):**
- LiveView test context setup (20 tests)
- Auth test environment (1 test)
- Mock data generation (45 tests)

**Future Enhancements (documented in PRD3_COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION.md):**

**High Priority:**
1. Fix remaining test context issues
2. Add caching for component templates
3. Implement lazy loading for large libraries
4. Animation transitions for layouts

**Medium Priority:**
4. Component versioning system
5. Style inheritance and cascading
6. AI command history and favorites
7. GraphQL API for components

**Low Priority:**
8. Figma import/export plugin
9. SVG asset library
10. Analytics dashboard
11. A/B testing framework
