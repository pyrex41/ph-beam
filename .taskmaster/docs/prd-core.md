PRD 1: Core Collaboration & System Resilience
Theme: Building a foundation of trust and reliability for seamless teamwork.
Vision & Goal: To fortify the application's real-time infrastructure, ensuring that no work is ever lost and that collaboration is transparent and frictionless, even under adverse network conditions or high user load.
Target Persona: The Collaborative Team Leader, who values system stability, data integrity, and clear communication within the tool.
Feature ID	Feature Name	Description & User Value	Acceptance Criteria & Metrics	Technical Implementation Notes
CR-01	Offline Operation Queue	When a client loses connection, all subsequent canvas operations (create, update, delete) will be queued locally. Upon reconnection, the queue syncs automatically. User Value: Provides peace of mind, allowing users on unstable networks to continue working without fear of data loss.	1. A visual UI indicator clearly shows "Offline" and "Reconnecting" states. 2. A queue of at least 20 operations can be stored locally. 3. Upon reconnection, all queued operations are synced successfully within 5 seconds with no data corruption, and become visible to other users.	- Frontend: Implement a state machine in canvas_manager.js to manage connection status. Use IndexedDB for robust local storage of the operation queue. <br>- Backend: CanvasLive will need an event handler to process the batch of queued operations from a reconnected client.
CR-02	Enhanced Edit & Presence Indicators	Improve situational awareness by displaying a small avatar or name tag next to an object currently locked by another user. Handle "rapid edit storm" scenarios by ensuring the last-write-wins model (via locking) resolves cleanly. User Value: Eliminates confusion about who is working on what, preventing accidental overwrites and making collaboration feel more intuitive and personal.	1. Locking an object displays the editor's avatar/name tag within 100ms. 2. A simulated "delete-vs-edit" conflict resolves predictably (e.g., the delete action wins and the editor is notified). 3. System remains stable under a test of 10+ edits/sec on a single object.	- Backend: Add user avatar/name to the Presence metadata. When an object is locked, CanvasLive will broadcast this richer information. <br>- Frontend: The CanvasRenderer hook in JS will render the avatar tag next to locked objects based on the broadcasted data.
CR-03	AI-Aware Undo/Redo System	Implement a robust history stack for canvas operations with support for Cmd/Ctrl+Z (Undo) and Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z (Redo). Multi-object operations, including those generated by the AI, will be treated as single, atomic undoable actions. User Value: A fundamental feature for creative confidence. It encourages experimentation and allows for risk-free correction of mistakes.	1. At least 50 consecutive actions can be undone. 2. An AI command that creates 5 objects can be undone in a single step. 3. Undo/redo actions are synced and visible across all collaborators' screens.	- Frontend: A history stack will be managed in canvas_manager.js. User-initiated undos will send an event to the server. <br>- Backend: CanvasLive will handle the logic for reversing an action (e.g., deleting a created object, reverting an update) and broadcasting the change.
CR-04	Performance & Scalability Test Suite	Create an automated test suite using Puppeteer to simulate high-load scenarios. The tests will measure FPS, memory usage, and sync latency with 2,000+ objects and 10+ concurrent users. User Value: Guarantees the application remains fast and delightful to use as projects grow, building confidence in its professional-grade capabilities.	1. Maintain >45 FPS with 2,000 objects and 10 active users. 2. Object sync latency must remain below 150ms under load. 3. Test reports are generated to track performance regressions over time.	- Tooling: Set up Puppeteer within the project's test environment. <br>- Tests: Write scripts that programmatically connect multiple clients, create thousands of objects via pushEvent, and measure rendering performance using browser performance APIs.
DR-01	Expanded Architecture Documentation	Update the project's README.md and CLAUDE.md to include detailed architecture diagrams and explanations for the real-time sync flow, the offline queue mechanism, and the AI agent's decision-making process. User Value: Improves project maintainability, accelerates onboarding for new developers, and clarifies the system's design.	1. The README contains a diagram illustrating the LiveView -> PubSub -> Client flow. 2. CLAUDE.md documents the flow for a complex, multi-tool AI command.	- Create diagrams using a tool like Mermaid.js or Excalidraw and embed them in the Markdown files.
Cross-PRD Dependencies & Integration:
The Undo/Redo system (CR-03) is foundational and will need to support actions from all features in PRD #2 and PRD #3.
The Performance Test Suite (CR-04) should be used to validate the performance of new features introduced in PRD #2.
Risks & Mitigation:
Risk: The complexity of the Undo/Redo logic for multi-user actions is high. Mitigation: Start with a per-user undo stack and clearly define which actions are shared vs. local.
Risk: Browser storage limitations or bugs (IndexedDB). Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and clear any corrupted local data to allow for a clean server-side sync.
