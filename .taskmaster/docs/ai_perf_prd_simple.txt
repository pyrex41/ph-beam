# AI Performance Optimization with Groq

## Overview
Optimize AI agent to achieve sub-2-second responses using Groq as primary LLM provider.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Fast Path Implementation (Critical - 1-2 days)

**Task: Implement Command Classifier Module**
Create classification system to route commands to optimal LLM provider.
- Pattern-based classification using regex
- Classify as :fast_path or :complex_path
- Detect multiple operations, context references, components
- Default to :fast_path for simple commands
- Add debug logging
Priority: High | Time: 4 hours

**Task: Create Provider Behaviour and Groq Implementation**
Implement LLM provider abstraction with Groq as primary.
- Define Provider behaviour with call/3, model_name/0, avg_latency/0
- Implement Groq provider using llama-3.3-70b-versatile
- Convert tool definitions to OpenAI format
- Parse responses and handle errors
- Add latency tracking
Priority: High | Time: 6 hours

**Task: Integrate Command Routing in Agent**
Update Agent to route commands through classifier.
- Use CommandClassifier.classify/1
- Route :fast_path to Groq
- Implement fallback to Claude if Groq fails
- Add performance logging
- Maintain backward compatibility
Priority: High | Time: 4 hours

### Phase 2: Parallel Execution (High Value - 2-3 days)

**Task: Add Parallel Tool Execution**
Replace sequential tool execution with Task.async_stream.
- Use Task.async_stream with max_concurrency: 10
- Set 5-second timeout per tool
- Handle task failures gracefully
- Maintain execution order in results
- Add performance metrics
Priority: High | Time: 5 hours

**Task: Create Tool Behaviour System**
Implement modular tool system with behaviours.
- Define ToolBehaviour with schema/0, validate/1, execute/3
- Create ToolRegistry with compile-time map for O(1) lookup
- Add Ecto.Changeset validation
- Generate tool definitions automatically
Priority: Medium | Time: 8 hours

**Task: Refactor Core Tools to Behaviour Pattern**
Refactor existing tools to implement ToolBehaviour.
- Refactor CreateShape, CreateText, MoveObject
- Refactor ResizeObject, DeleteObject, CreateComponent
- Each tool has Ecto schema for validation
- Each tool in separate file
Priority: Medium | Time: 6 hours

### Phase 3: Configuration and Testing (Essential)

**Task: Add Configuration and Feature Flags**
Add configuration for providers and rollout flags.
- Environment variables for API keys
- Config for default and fallback providers
- Feature flag for fast_path
- Timeout configurations
Priority: High | Time: 2 hours

**Task: Write Comprehensive Tests**
Create comprehensive test suite.
- Unit tests for all new modules
- Integration tests for end-to-end flow
- Performance tests validating < 1s for simple commands
- Error handling and fallback tests
- 90%+ code coverage
Priority: High | Time: 6 hours

**Task: Add Performance Monitoring**
Add telemetry for AI performance tracking.
- Emit telemetry events for command execution
- Track latency by command type
- Track provider usage and error rates
- Add dashboard for metrics
Priority: Medium | Time: 4 hours

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional)

**Task: Add Layout Tools**
Implement AI-powered layout and arrangement.
- Create Layout module with algorithms
- Implement ArrangeObjects tool (grid, horizontal, vertical)
- Implement AlignObjects tool (left, center, right, etc)
- Add layout patterns to classifier
Priority: Low | Time: 8 hours

**Task: Add Streaming Support**
Implement streaming responses for better UX.
- Add streaming to Groq provider
- Create StreamingAgent module
- Update LiveView for incremental updates
- Add progress indicators
Priority: Low | Time: 10 hours

**Task: Documentation and Migration Guide**
Create documentation for new AI system.
- Update AGENTS.md with new architecture
- Document provider and tool behaviour systems
- Create migration guide
- Update API documentation
Priority: Medium | Time: 3 hours

## Performance Targets

- Simple commands: < 1 second (70% of use cases)
- Multi-tool commands: < 1.5 seconds
- Layout commands: < 2 seconds
- Complex components: < 2.5 seconds
- Cost reduction: 50%+ vs Claude-only

## Success Criteria

Phase 1-2 Implementation:
- 70% of commands complete in < 1 second
- 90% of commands complete in < 2 seconds
- No increase in error rate
- All existing functionality preserved
- 50%+ cost reduction
