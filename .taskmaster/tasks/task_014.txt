# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement PixiJS Canvas Manager Hook
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the main PixiJS hook for canvas interaction and rendering.
# Details:
Build assets/js/hooks/canvas_manager.js with CanvasManager class. Initialize PixiJS app, handle object loading, setup event listeners for drawing, pan/zoom, and server events. Implement object creation, updating, and rendering with PixiJS graphics.

# Test Strategy:
Mount the hook on a canvas page, verify PixiJS canvas renders, and test basic object creation and movement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize PixiJS Application [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the PixiJS application instance in the CanvasManager class, including creating the app with appropriate width, height, and background color.
### Details:
In assets/js/hooks/canvas_manager.js, within the CanvasManager class constructor, initialize a new PixiJS Application with options for width, height, background color, and append the view to the provided canvas element. Ensure the app is properly configured for WebGL rendering.

## 2. Handle Object Loading and Rendering [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Implement functions to load and render canvas objects using PixiJS graphics, including creating shapes, text, and updating their positions.
### Details:
Add methods to the CanvasManager class for creating PixiJS Graphics objects (e.g., rectangles, circles) and Text objects based on object data. Implement rendering logic to add these to the PixiJS stage and update them on changes, ensuring efficient redrawing.

## 3. Setup Event Listeners for Interactions [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Configure event listeners for user interactions such as drawing, panning, zooming, and object selection on the PixiJS canvas.
### Details:
In the CanvasManager class, attach event listeners to the PixiJS view for mouse and touch events. Implement handlers for drawing new objects, panning the canvas, zooming in/out, and selecting/moving existing objects, using PixiJS interaction manager.

## 4. Implement Server Event Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Integrate handling of server-sent events to update the canvas state, such as receiving updates from other users and applying them to the PixiJS stage.
### Details:
Add methods in CanvasManager to listen for WebSocket or server events, parse incoming data for object updates, creations, or deletions, and apply these changes to the PixiJS graphics. Ensure synchronization with the server state without disrupting local interactions.

## 5. Test Basic Rendering and Interactions [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Verify that the PixiJS canvas renders correctly and responds to basic user interactions and server events.
### Details:
Mount the CanvasManager hook on a test canvas page. Check that the PixiJS app initializes without errors, objects render properly, event listeners trigger expected behaviors (e.g., drawing a shape, panning), and server events update the canvas in real-time.
