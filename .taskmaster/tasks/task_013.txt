# Task ID: 13
# Title: Install and Configure PixiJS
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up PixiJS for WebGL-based canvas rendering.
# Details:
Add PixiJS to assets/package.json and install with npm. Update assets/js/app.js to import PixiJS. Ensure esbuild configuration handles the import. Test basic PixiJS rendering in a simple hook.

# Test Strategy:
Run 'npm install' in assets, build assets, and verify PixiJS loads without errors in browser console.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add PixiJS to assets/package.json [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the PixiJS dependency to the package.json file in the assets directory to prepare for installation.
### Details:
Locate the assets/package.json file and add 'pixi.js' as a dependency in the dependencies section. Ensure the version is compatible with the project setup.

## 2. Install PixiJS with npm [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Run npm install to download and install PixiJS and its dependencies into the assets/node_modules.
### Details:
Navigate to the assets directory in the terminal and execute 'npm install' to install all dependencies, including the newly added PixiJS. This should complete without errors.

## 3. Update assets/js/app.js to import PixiJS [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Modify the main JavaScript file to import PixiJS for use in the application.
### Details:
Open assets/js/app.js and add an import statement for PixiJS, such as 'import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';'. Ensure the import is placed appropriately in the file structure.

## 4. Ensure esbuild configuration handles PixiJS import [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Verify and adjust the esbuild configuration to properly bundle PixiJS imports.
### Details:
Review the esbuild configuration file (likely in assets or root) to ensure it can handle ES6 imports like PixiJS. If needed, add any necessary loaders or settings for WebGL-related modules.

## 5. Test basic PixiJS rendering in a simple hook [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Create a simple test to verify PixiJS is rendering correctly on a canvas element.
### Details:
In the app.js or a test hook, initialize a PixiJS Application, create a basic sprite or shape, and append the view to a DOM element. Ensure it renders without errors in the browser.
