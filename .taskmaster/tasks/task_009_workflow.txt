# Task ID: 9
# Title: Frontend Implementation for Reusable Color Palettes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update ColorPicker LiveComponent to display and manage palettes.
# Details:
Modify ColorPicker to show saved palettes, allow creation of new ones, and enable single-click application of colors. Integrate with backend context. Pseudo-code: In LiveComponent, render palette list; on click, apply color to selected object.

# Test Strategy:
Test creating and saving palettes, and applying colors with a single click.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update ColorPicker LiveComponent to Render Palette List [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the ColorPicker LiveComponent to display a list of saved color palettes fetched from the backend.
### Details:
In the LiveComponent's render function, add a section to display palettes as a list or grid of color swatches. Ensure the component fetches palettes from the backend context on mount or update.

## 2. Implement Palette Creation Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Add UI elements and logic to allow users to create new color palettes within the ColorPicker component.
### Details:
Introduce a button or form in the ColorPicker to create a new palette. On creation, collect selected colors and send a pushEvent to the backend to save the palette. Update the palette list dynamically after creation.

## 3. Enable Single-Click Color Application from Palettes [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement event handlers to apply a color to the selected object with a single click on a palette color.
### Details:
Add click event listeners to each color swatch in the palettes. On click, apply the color to the currently selected object on the canvas by triggering the appropriate pushEvent to the backend context.

## 4. Integrate Backend for Saving Palettes [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Connect the palette creation process to the backend to persist new palettes.
### Details:
Modify the palette creation logic to send a 'save_palette' event with palette data (name, colors) to the CanvasLive backend. Handle the response to update the local state and refresh the palette list.

## 5. Integrate Backend for Loading Palettes [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Ensure palettes are loaded from the backend when the ColorPicker component initializes.
### Details:
On component mount, send a 'load_palettes' event to fetch all saved palettes from the backend. Populate the palette list with the returned data and handle any updates in real-time via LiveView subscriptions.
