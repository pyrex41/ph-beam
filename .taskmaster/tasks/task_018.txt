# Task ID: 18
# Title: Add Complex AI Component Creation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functions for creating complex UI components like login forms and nav bars.
# Details:
In AI agent, add logic for create_login_form, create_nav_bar, and create_card that execute multiple tool calls. Handle component positioning and styling defaults.

# Test Strategy:
Execute AI commands for complex components and verify all sub-objects are created correctly in the canvas.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Functions for Complex Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the basic functions for create_login_form, create_nav_bar, and create_card in the AI agent, focusing on their core logic without multiple tool calls yet.
### Details:
In the AI agent module, add skeleton functions for each component type. Define default parameters for positioning (e.g., x, y coordinates) and styling (e.g., colors, fonts). Ensure each function returns a component object structure.

## 2. Integrate Multiple Tool Calls for Component Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Extend the component creation functions to execute multiple tool calls, such as creating shapes, texts, and positioning them accordingly.
### Details:
Modify create_login_form, create_nav_bar, and create_card to call multiple AI tools (e.g., create_shape, create_text, move_shape) in sequence. Handle orchestration of these calls, ensuring components are assembled correctly with proper positioning and styling defaults applied.

## 3. Test and Validate Component Creation Accuracy [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure complex components are created accurately, including edge cases and multi-user scenarios.
### Details:
Run tests in a simulated canvas environment, checking for correct rendering, positioning, and styling. Validate that components handle multiple tool calls without errors and sync properly in real-time if applicable.
