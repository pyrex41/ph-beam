# Task ID: 4
# Title: Set Up Auth0 Application
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure Auth0 for authentication, including creating an application and setting callback URLs. The setup is now fully documented with detailed implementation notes for all subtasks, including a complete step-by-step guide in AUTH0_SETUP_GUIDE.md and a verification checklist in AUTH0_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md.
# Details:
Sign up for Auth0, create a new application as 'Regular Web Application', copy Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret. Configure allowed callback URLs for localhost and production, enable Google and GitHub social logins. Note the credentials for environment variables. The setup process is fully documented: Created AUTH0_SETUP_GUIDE.md with complete step-by-step instructions for all Auth0 configuration. Created AUTH0_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md for verification. Updated .env.example with AUTH0_DOMAIN, AUTH0_CLIENT_ID, AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET, and AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL placeholders. Verified .gitignore includes .env to prevent credential exposure. User must now complete the actual Auth0 dashboard configuration by following AUTH0_SETUP_GUIDE.md, then copy credentials to .env file. Once all steps are verified using AUTH0_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md, mark task as done.

# Test Strategy:
Follow AUTH0_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md to verify all Auth0 configurations, including dashboard settings and credential setup; test login flow manually in a browser after completion.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Sign up for Auth0 account [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new account on Auth0 if not already registered, to access the dashboard for configuration.

Auth0 account setup - This is an external configuration step. User needs to visit https://auth0.com/ and either sign up for a new account or log in to existing account. Free tier is sufficient for development. Once logged in, user should have access to the Auth0 dashboard at https://manage.auth0.com/. This subtask is complete when user has verified dashboard access.
