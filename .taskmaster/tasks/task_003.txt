Successfully integrated CollabCanvasWeb.Presence into the application supervisor in lib/collab_canvas/application.ex. The Presence module is now started as part of the supervision tree after PubSub and before the Endpoint. Tested presence tracking functionality with a comprehensive test script that verified: 1) Tracking users with metadata (cursor position, color, name), 2) Listing presence for a topic, 3) Tracking multiple users simultaneously, 4) Getting presence for specific users. All tests passed successfully, confirming CRDT-backed presence tracking is working correctly.
