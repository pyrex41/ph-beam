		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Offline Operation Queue",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation into subtasks for frontend state management, local storage handling, backend batch processing, and UI indicators.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves managing connection states, implementing robust local storage with IndexedDB, and ensuring reliable syncing upon reconnection, which requires careful handling of edge cases like data corruption and performance. It has moderate technical challenges in frontend-backend coordination and testing for offline scenarios, leading to a score of 6."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Enhanced Edit & Presence Indicators",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for backend metadata enhancement and broadcasting, and frontend rendering and conflict resolution.",
			"reasoning": "The task requires integrating user presence data with object locking and real-time broadcasting, with some complexity in handling rapid edit conflicts. While it builds on existing PubSub infrastructure, the need for low-latency rendering and predictable conflict resolution adds moderate effort, scoring 5."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI-Aware Undo/Redo System",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for frontend history stack management, backend action reversal logic, support for atomic multi-object operations including AI-generated ones, and cross-client synchronization.",
			"reasoning": "Building on dependencies 1 and 2, this task demands a sophisticated history mechanism supporting atomic undos for complex operations, real-time syncing, and AI integration, increasing technical challenges in state management and broadcasting. High testing requirements for 50+ actions and multi-user visibility contribute to a score of 8."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Performance & Scalability Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into subtasks for setting up Puppeteer environment, scripting high-load simulations, and implementing metric collection and reporting.",
			"reasoning": "This involves advanced testing automation with Puppeteer to simulate concurrent users and measure performance metrics like FPS and latency under load, dependent on tasks 1-3. The effort in scripting realistic scenarios and ensuring accurate measurements adds complexity, scoring 7."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Update Expanded Architecture Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into subtasks for creating and embedding diagrams in README.md and CLAUDE.md, and documenting specific flows like sync, offline queue, and AI processes.",
			"reasoning": "Primarily documentation-focused with diagram creation, this task has low implementation effort and minimal technical challenges, though it requires understanding the system's architecture. Low priority and straightforward testing lead to a score of 3."
