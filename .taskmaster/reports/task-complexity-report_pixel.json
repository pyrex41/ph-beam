			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create LiveView Module Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Standard Phoenix LiveView setup with basic assigns and event handlers. Moderate effort in structuring the module, but low technical challenges as it follows common patterns. Testing is unit-level and straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement File Upload Validation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for server-side validation using uploaded_entries, client-side JavaScript validation, error display, and consume_uploaded_entry processing.",
			"reasoning": "Involves both Elixir and JavaScript for validation, with dependencies on LiveView structure. Moderate technical challenges in coordinating client-server validation and error handling. Testing requires integration tests for various invalid cases."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Add Grid Size Selection Input",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Simple form input with validation, building on existing LiveView. Low technical challenges, as it's standard HTML select with basic Elixir validation. Effort is minimal, and testing is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Image Processing Function",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for image resizing with Mogrify, pixel extraction using Image library, RGB to hex conversion, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "High technical challenges in image manipulation, involving external libraries and pixel-level operations. Significant implementation effort for accurate processing and error handling. Testing requires unit tests with sample images and edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Canvas Rendering on Client",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into subtasks for setting up the canvas element, implementing the JavaScript hook for rendering, and handling canvas clearing and resizing.",
			"reasoning": "Involves JavaScript canvas APIs and LiveView push events. Moderate challenges in client-side rendering performance and accuracy. Testing includes browser-based verification of rendering speed and correctness."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Upload and Processing Flow",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for connecting upload validation, grid selection, image processing, and canvas rendering, plus ensuring temporary file cleanup.",
			"reasoning": "Integration task with multiple dependencies, requiring coordination of upload, processing, and rendering. High effort due to end-to-end flow and potential race conditions. Testing is comprehensive, including end-to-end scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add Error Handling and User Feedback",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for defining error cases, implementing error assigns and flash messages, and adding warnings for large grids.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate effort in handling various error scenarios and user feedback mechanisms. Technical challenges are low, but requires covering multiple failure points. Testing involves asserting error displays in different cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Performance for Large Grids",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for adding progress indicators, implementing image caching, optimizing Mogrify operations, and setting timeouts with memory monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization with high technical challenges, including caching, concurrency, and resource management. Significant effort in tuning for large grids and measuring performance. Testing requires benchmarks and stress tests."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Configure and Test Browser Compatibility",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into subtasks for testing on each supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and documenting any issues.",
			"reasoning": "Low effort in using standard canvas APIs, but requires testing across multiple browsers. Minimal technical challenges assuming HTML5 support. Testing is browser-specific and verification-focused."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Write Unit and Integration Tests",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for unit tests (e.g., process_image, validations), integration tests for LiveView flow, and performance tests with Benchee.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing across unit, integration, and performance levels. High effort in achieving coverage and validating criteria. Technical challenges in setting up test environments for image processing and browser interactions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Document and Prepare for Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for writing setup and user documentation, updating router and configs, and staging deployment tests.",
			"reasoning": "Low technical challenges, focused on documentation and configuration. Moderate effort in ensuring completeness. Testing is review and staging verification."
