			"expansionPrompt": "If expansion is needed, break down into subtasks for implementing Shift+Click multi-select, lasso selection rendering and logic, keyboard shortcuts for grouping/ungrouping, atomic transformation handling for groups, visual indicators for groups, and integration with backend events.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating complex UI interactions with PIXI.js graphics, event handling for multi-select and lasso, keyboard shortcuts, and ensuring atomic behavior for grouped objects, which requires careful state management and backend synchronization. Implementation effort includes adding multiple event listeners, graphics rendering, and transformation logic, with technical challenges in accurate selection detection and real-time syncing. It depends on backend Task 1 for group support. Testing requires verifying multi-object selections and group behaviors. The existing 2 subtasks already cover the core components adequately, so no further expansion is recommended."
