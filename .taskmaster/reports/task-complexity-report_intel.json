			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema for Components and Styles",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema implementation into subtasks for creating the components table, creating the styles table, and modifying the objects table, including migration scripts, constraints, and indexes.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves defining multiple database tables with specific fields, foreign keys, and constraints using Ecto migrations. It requires careful attention to schema accuracy and performance optimizations, but is relatively straightforward as a foundational backend task with moderate technical challenges in data modeling and testing migrations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Backend Context for Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for implementing each core function (create_component, instantiate_component, update_component), adding PubSub broadcasts, and handling nested components and versioning.",
			"reasoning": "Building a backend context with multiple functions, real-time broadcasts, and support for nested components adds complexity in logic flow, error handling, and integration with PubSub. Dependencies on the database schema increase effort, and testing requires unit and integration tests for reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Backend for AI-Powered Layouts",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into implementing each layout algorithm (distribute_horizontally, arrange_grid, etc.), integrating with AI tools, modifying the agent handler, and ensuring atomic batch updates.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing algorithmic layouts with precision requirements (Â±1px) and performance constraints (500ms for 50 objects) introduces technical challenges in computational accuracy and optimization. Integration with AI tools and batch updates adds layers of complexity in testing and dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Expand AI Command Vocabulary Backend",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for each new AI tool (resize_object, rotate_object, change_style, update_text, move_object), including input schemas, context functions, and update pipeline integration.",
			"reasoning": "Adding multiple AI tools with specific schemas and ensuring they flow through update pipelines and broadcasts requires careful implementation of each tool's logic. Multi-object support and undo/redo add testing effort, making it moderately complex despite being backend-focused."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Backend Context for Styles",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for defining style functions (create_style, apply_style, update_style), handling propagation, and adding design token export support.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to the components context, this involves implementing CRUD-like functions with PubSub and export features. It's less complex than AI-related tasks but still requires attention to real-time sync and testing across collaborators."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Frontend Components Panel",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for building the UI (thumbnails, search/filter), implementing drag-and-drop, handling events, and integrating real-time updates.",
			"reasoning": "Frontend UI development with interactive features like drag-and-drop, event handling, and collaborative sync is challenging due to user experience nuances and integration with backend. E2E testing adds significant effort, elevating complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate AI Layouts in Frontend",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks for modifying the AI interface for selection context, adding visual feedback, ensuring atomic updates, and implementing undo support.",
			"reasoning": "Enhancing the AI frontend for layout commands involves UI modifications, performance tuning (500ms target), and ensuring sync in collaborative sessions. It's moderately complex with a focus on frontend-backend integration and visual accuracy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Expanded AI Commands in Frontend",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for parsing and executing each command type (resize, rotate, etc.), adding visual indicators, and ensuring undo/redo and multi-user sync.",
			"reasoning": "Supporting multiple new command types in the frontend requires robust parsing, visual feedback, and sync mechanisms. E2E testing for accuracy and performance makes it comparable to other AI integration tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Frontend Styles Panel",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into building the UI (grids, previews, modals), implementing event handlers (create_style, etc.), and integrating export functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Creating a styles management UI with previews, modals, and event handling is complex due to design requirements and real-time integration. Performance targets (50ms) and collaborative testing add to the effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "System Integration and Performance Testing",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for wiring components, performance optimization (AI response, updates), comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E), and validating success metrics.",
			"reasoning": "This overarching task involves integrating all features, optimizing for multiple performance benchmarks, and conducting extensive testing across the system. High dependencies and the need for load testing and UAT make it the most complex, requiring coordination and thorough validation."
