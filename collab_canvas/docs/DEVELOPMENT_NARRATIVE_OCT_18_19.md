**Agent Track Completion:** 73% (11/15 complete, 2 deferred, 2 cancelled)

---

### What Wasn't Done (And Why)

#### Strategic Deferrals (Updated Oct 19, 2025)
1. ~~**Offline Queue (CR-01):**~~ ✅ **NOW COMPLETE** - Full IndexedDB implementation verified in code audit.
2. **Performance Test Suite (CR-04):** Puppeteer set up, but full suite deferred. Manual testing sufficient for current scale.
3. **Shape Tools (WF-03):** Backend ready, frontend deferred. Not critical path for launch.
4. ~~**Color Palette UI (WF-05):**~~ ✅ **NOW COMPLETE** - Full frontend UI with HSL sliders verified in code audit.

#### Cancelled Work
1. **ETS Cache (agent #1, #10):** Complexity didn't justify performance gains. Short-circuiting (task #6-7) achieved similar latency improvements more simply.
2. **Parallel Tool Processing (agent #9):** Deferred as batching (task #8) solved the primary performance issue. Task.async_stream adds complexity with marginal benefit.

#### Pending Work (Still Planned)
1. **Workflow Tasks (10 tasks pending):** Backend for selection/grouping/layers complete. Frontend implementation scheduled for next sprint.
2. **Core Tasks (5 tasks pending, 14 subtasks):** Foundation for offline, testing, and advanced presence. Next major feature push.
3. **Design Tasks (15 tasks pending):** Advanced AI design features. Future roadmap items.

### October 19, 2025

#### Early Morning: Multi-Select and Layer Management (PR #9)

**Critical Bug Fix:**
Objects jumped vertically (hundreds of pixels) when dragged by one client and viewed by another.

**Root Cause:** Coordinate system mismatch between `getGlobalPosition()` (world coordinates) and `obj.x/obj.y` (local coordinates).

**Solution:** Convert all positions to `objectContainer` local space before sending to server.

**Layer Management Features:**
- Position numbers for each layer (#1 = front-most)
- Smart filtering (selected object + 10 before/after, or top 50)
- Layer count display ("Showing X of Y layers (+Z hidden)")
- Visual indicators (Front/Back tags)
- Right-click context menu (Bring to Front, Move Forward, etc.)
- Click layer to select object on canvas

**Lock Timeout System:**
- Automatic 10-minute lock expiration
- `locked_at` timestamp tracking
- Lock timestamp refreshed on user interaction
- Backward compatible with legacy locks

**Migration:** `20251019014043_add_locked_at_to_objects.exs`

**PR #9 Merged:** October 19, 02:20 UTC

---

#### Mid-Morning: AI Batching Implementation (Task #8)

**Feature:** Batch creation for `create_*` tool calls to improve AI performance.

**Implementation:**
- Detect when AI returns multiple `create_*` tool calls
- Group them into a single database transaction
- Single PubSub broadcast for all objects
- Reduces network overhead and improves perceived performance

**Commit:** `8b2749a` - feat: implement batching for create_* tool calls

**Impact:**
- Faster AI command execution for multi-object operations
- Reduced server load
- Better user experience for complex AI requests

---

#### Late Morning: Voice UI Improvements

**Voice Dialog Enhancements:**
1. **Draggability Improvements** (`59aa369`)
   - Enhanced drag handle behavior
   - Added position memory (dialog remembers last position)
   - More intuitive interaction model

2. **Visual Polish** (`7768c94`)
   - Changed cursor to grab hand for better affordance
   - Clearer indication of draggable area

3. **Keyboard Interaction** (`51ccbd7`)
   - Fixed issue where Escape key would cancel voice recording AND focus input
   - Now cancels recording without unwanted focus changes

4. **Audio Feedback** (`0c25a39`)
   - Added error sound playback
   - Volume control for audio feedback
   - Better user awareness of errors

**User Impact:** Voice interface is now more polished, intuitive, and production-ready.

#### Afternoon: Server-Side Undo/Redo System

**Major Feature:** Database-backed undo/redo history system.

**Implementation Details:**

**Phase 1: Server-Side Undo/Redo** (`c2d18e5`)
- Operation tracking on the server
- Database persistence of operation history
- Support for collaborative undo/redo
- Properly handles multi-user scenarios

**Phase 2: Database-Backed System** (`f332db0`)
- Full database integration
- History preserved across sessions
- Scalable to large canvases
- Enables future features (branching history, selective undo)

**Architecture:**
- Operations stored in database with timestamps
- Each operation includes: type, target, before/after states
- Server manages operation log per canvas
- Clients can request undo/redo from server

**Benefits:**
- Persistent undo/redo across page refreshes
- Multi-user undo coordination
- Foundation for advanced features (history branching, time travel)

**Note:** This is a major architectural enhancement that goes beyond the client-side history manager implemented in CR-03.

---

#### Late Afternoon: Docker and Deployment Fixes

**Problem:** Docker builds failing due to platform-specific dependencies (Rollup binary issues).

**Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Use `npm ci` for Deterministic Builds** (`53cdc30`)
   - Switched from `npm install` to `npm ci`
   - Ensures optional dependencies installed correctly
   - More predictable Docker builds

2. **Platform-Specific Dependency Rebuilding** (`c9254f0`)
   - Added `npm rebuild` step
