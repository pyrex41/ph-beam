## Key Findings

### Implemented Features

1. **Component Generation** (component_builder.ex)
   - 5 pre-built component types (login form, navbar, card, button group, sidebar)
   - Theme support (4 themes: light, dark, blue, green)

2. **Basic AI Tools** (7 tools)
   - create_shape, create_text, move_shape, resize_shape, delete_object, group_objects, create_component

3. **Real-time Canvas**
   - Multi-user collaborative editing
   - Object locking for concurrent editing
   - PixiJS rendering

4. **AI Integration**
   - Claude API integration for natural language commands
   - Function calling for tool execution

### Critical Gaps

1. **Component System** - No instance/override/propagation system
2. **Layout Commands** - No multi-select, no distribute/align algorithms
3. **Design Tokens** - No token database or management system
4. **Style Tools** - No fill/color/opacity/rotation modification tools

## Timeline

**Overall Status:** 35% complete

| Phase | Duration | Features | Status |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | 1-2 weeks | Multi-select, DB schema, layout algorithms | Not started |
| Phase 2: Components | 2-3 weeks | Instance system, overrides, propagation | Not started |
| Phase 3: Layouts | 1-2 weeks | Distribute/align AI tools | Not started |
| Phase 4: Design Tokens | 2-3 weeks | Token DB, palette manager, export | Not started |
| Phase 5: Polish | 1-2 weeks | Rotate, opacity, advanced commands | Not started |

**Total Estimated Time to 90% Complete: 8-12 weeks**

## How to Use These Documents

### For Project Managers:
1. Read `PRD3_SUMMARY.md` for status overview
2. Refer to timeline and roadmap for planning

### For Developers:
1. Start with `PRD3_SUMMARY.md` for overview
2. Read `PRD3_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md` for feature details
3. Use `IMPLEMENTATION_FILE_REFERENCE.md` while coding

### For Architects:
1. Read all three documents for complete understanding
2. Focus on database schema gaps in IMPLEMENTATION_FILE_REFERENCE.md
3. Review technical debt section in ANALYSIS document

## Key Metrics

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Component System | 15% (builder only, no instances) |
| Layout Commands | 0% (no multi-select, no algorithms) |
| AI Vocabulary | 30% (7 basic tools, missing transforms) |
| Design Tokens | 0% (hardcoded themes, no DB) |
| **Overall** | **35% Complete** |

## What's Working Right Now

Users can currently:
- Create basic shapes (rectangles, circles)
- Create text
- Generate pre-built UI components (login form, navbar, card, buttons, sidebar)
- Drag/move objects
- Delete objects
- Edit in real-time with other users
- See other users' cursors
- Lock objects for collaborative editing

## What's Missing for Production PRD 3.0

Users cannot yet:
- Reuse component templates (save and create from main components)
- Select multiple objects
- Distribute objects with equal spacing
- Align objects (left/right/center/top/bottom)
- Rotate objects
- Change object colors/properties after creation
- Use design tokens/palettes
- Export design tokens for use in code
