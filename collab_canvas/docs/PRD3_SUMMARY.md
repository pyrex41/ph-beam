# PRD 3.0 Implementation Status - Quick Summary

## Overall: 35% Complete

### Feature Breakdown:

#### 1. Reusable Component System (3.1): 15% Complete
- **Working:** Hardcoded component builders (login form, navbar, card, button group, sidebar)
- **Missing:** Component storage, instances, overrides, propagation
- **Critical Gap:** No instance system - components are one-time generated, not reusable templates

#### 2. AI-Powered Layouts (3.2): 0% Complete  
- **Working:** Single object creation and movement
- **Missing:** Multi-select, distribute, align, arrange in grid/circle algorithms
- **Critical Gap:** No layout AI tools or multi-select support

#### 3. Expanded AI Commands (3.3): 30% Complete
- **Working:** 7 basic tools (create_shape, create_text, move_shape, resize_shape, delete, group, create_component)
- **Missing:** Rotate, change fill/stroke, opacity, text editing, bring-to-front, layer commands
- **Critical Gap:** Limited to absolute operations, no property modification tools

#### 4. Styles & Design Tokens (3.4): 0% Complete
- **Working:** 4 hardcoded themes with color values
- **Missing:** Token database, palette manager, text styles, effect styles, export
- **Critical Gap:** Colors hardcoded in Elixir, not database-driven

## Key Files

**Backend (Elixir):**
- `/collab_canvas/lib/collab_canvas/ai/component_builder.ex` - Component generation (5 types)
- `/collab_canvas/lib/collab_canvas/ai/agent.ex` - AI command orchestration  
- `/collab_canvas/lib/collab_canvas/ai/tools.ex` - Tool definitions (7 tools)
- `/collab_canvas/lib/collab_canvas/ai/themes.ex` - Hardcoded color themes
- `/collab_canvas/lib/collab_canvas/canvases/object.ex` - Object schema (basic fields only)

**Frontend (JavaScript):**
- `/collab_canvas/assets/js/hooks/canvas_manager.js` - PixiJS canvas rendering
  - Single object selection only
  - No multi-select support
  - No layout UI

**Database:**
- `/collab_canvas/priv/repo/migrations/` - 4 migrations (users, canvases, objects, locked_by)

## Biggest Gaps

| Feature | Impact | Why Missing |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Instance System | Blocks all component reuse | No DB schema for components/instances |
| Multi-Select | Blocks all layout commands | Frontend only tracks one selected object |
| Layout Algorithms | Required for AI layouts | Not implemented |
| Design Token DB | Required for consistency | Colors hardcoded in code |
| Rotate/Transform | Blocks professional use | Data schema doesn't support rotation |
| Style Tools | Blocks design workflows | Only component-level theming, not object-level |

## What Works NOW

1. Create basic shapes via AI: "Create a blue rectangle"
2. Generate pre-built components: Login form, navbar, card, buttons, sidebar
3. Drag/move objects
4. Delete objects
5. Collaborative editing (multi-user with presence)
6. Object locking/unlocking for concurrent editing

---

## Quick Start for Implementation

1. **Phase 1 (Foundation)** - Add multi-select UI & component schema
2. **Phase 2 (Components)** - Implement instance system with overrides
3. **Phase 3 (Layouts)** - Build distribute/align algorithms  
4. **Phase 4 (Tokens)** - Create design token storage & UI
5. **Phase 5 (Polish)** - Add rotate, opacity, advanced commands

**Estimated Total Time:** 8-12 weeks for production-ready PRD 3.0
