# Task 15 Implementation: Object Creation, Update, and Delete

## Completed Features

### 1. Enhanced CanvasManager Hook (`assets/js/hooks/canvas_manager.js`)

#### New CRUD Methods:
- ✅ `createRectangle()` - Creates rectangle with fill, stroke, and dimensions
- ✅ `createCircle()` - Creates circle with radius and styling
- ✅ `createText()` - Creates text with custom font, size, and color
- ✅ `updateObject()` - Updates object position and data
- ✅ `removeObject()` / `deleteObject()` - Removes objects from canvas
- ✅ `findObjectAt(x, y)` - Finds object at given position for selection

#### New Interaction Features:

**Tool Selection:**
- ✅ Select tool (S key)
- ✅ Rectangle tool (R key) - Click & drag to create
- ✅ Circle tool (C key) - Click & drag to create
- ✅ Text tool (T key) - Click to prompt and create
- ✅ Delete tool (D key) - Click object to delete

**Object Creation with Click & Drag:**
- ✅ `createTempObject()` - Creates temporary preview during drag
- ✅ `updateTempObject()` - Updates preview as user drags
- ✅ `finalizeTempObject()` - Creates final object on mouse up
- ✅ Minimum size threshold (10px) to prevent tiny objects

**Object Selection & Manipulation:**
- ✅ `showSelection()` - Shows blue selection box around selected object
- ✅ `clearSelection()` - Removes selection box
- ✅ Click object to select
- ✅ Drag selected object to move
- ✅ Delete/Backspace key to delete selected object
- ✅ Escape key to deselect

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- ✅ R - Rectangle tool
- ✅ C - Circle tool
- ✅ T - Text tool
- ✅ D - Delete tool
- ✅ S - Select tool
- ✅ Delete/Backspace - Delete selected object
- ✅ Escape - Clear selection and return to select tool

**Additional Features:**
- ✅ Pan with Shift+Drag or middle mouse
- ✅ Zoom with mouse wheel
- ✅ Visual feedback during object creation
- ✅ Proper handling of input fields (keyboard shortcuts disabled when typing)

### 2. Updated Canvas LiveView (`lib/collab_canvas_web/live/canvas_live.ex`)

#### Enhanced Event Handlers:
- ✅ `handle_event("create_object")` - Creates objects with proper data encoding
- ✅ `handle_event("update_object")` - Updates objects, handles both "id" and "object_id" params
- ✅ `handle_event("delete_object")` - Deletes objects, handles both "id" and "object_id" params
- ✅ `handle_event("select_tool")` - Updates selected tool in UI

#### Enhanced UI:
- ✅ Added Delete tool button with red highlighting
- ✅ Added keyboard shortcut indicators (S, R, C, T, D) on toolbar buttons
- ✅ Enhanced tooltips with keyboard shortcuts and usage instructions
- ✅ Added "Shift + Drag = Pan" helper text
- ✅ Improved button styling for better visual feedback

### 3. Server-Side Integration

All operations sync properly with the server via:
- ✅ PubSub broadcasts for real-time multi-user updates
- ✅ Database persistence through Canvases context
- ✅ Proper object creation with position and data
- ✅ Object updates with position tracking
- ✅ Object deletion with cleanup

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/reuben/gauntlet/figma-clone/ph-beam/collab_canvas
   mix phx.server
   ```

2. **Navigate to a canvas:**
   - Go to http://localhost:4000
   - Create or select a canvas

3. **Test Rectangle Tool:**
   - Press R or click Rectangle button
   - Click and drag on canvas
   - Release to create rectangle
   - Rectangle should appear with blue fill and stroke

4. **Test Circle Tool:**
   - Press C or click Circle button
   - Click and drag on canvas
   - Release to create circle
   - Circle should appear with blue fill and stroke

5. **Test Text Tool:**
   - Press T or click Text button
   - Click on canvas
   - Enter text in prompt
   - Text should appear at click position

6. **Test Select & Move:**
   - Press S or click Select button
   - Click on any object to select (blue selection box appears)
   - Drag to move object
   - Release to save new position

7. **Test Delete:**
   - Method 1: Press D, then click object
   - Method 2: Select object with S, then press Delete/Backspace
   - Object should disappear immediately

8. **Test Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Test all keyboard shortcuts (R, C, T, D, S)
   - Test Delete/Backspace on selected object
   - Test Escape to deselect

9. **Test Multi-User Sync:**
   - Open canvas in two browser windows
   - Create object in one window
   - Verify it appears in other window
   - Move object in one window
   - Verify it moves in other window
   - Delete object in one window
   - Verify it disappears in other window

10. **Test Pan & Zoom:**
    - Hold Shift and drag to pan
    - Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
    - Objects should stay in correct positions

## Implementation Files Modified

1. `/Users/reuben/gauntlet/figma-clone/ph-beam/collab_canvas/assets/js/hooks/canvas_manager.js`
   - Added click & drag object creation
   - Added selection system with visual feedback
   - Added keyboard shortcuts (R, C, T, D, S, Delete, Escape)
   - Added tool management system
   - Added helper methods for object manipulation

2. `/Users/reuben/gauntlet/figma-clone/ph-beam/collab_canvas/lib/collab_canvas_web/live/canvas_live.ex`
   - Updated event handlers to accept both "id" and "object_id" params
   - Added Delete tool button to UI
   - Added keyboard shortcut indicators to toolbar
   - Enhanced tooltips with usage instructions

## Technical Details

### Object Creation Flow:
1. User presses R/C key or clicks tool button
2. User clicks on canvas (mousedown)
3. `createTempObject()` creates visual preview
4. User drags (mousemove)
5. `updateTempObject()` updates preview continuously
6. User releases (mouseup)
7. `finalizeTempObject()` checks size threshold
8. If valid, sends `create_object` event to server
9. Server creates object in database
10. Server broadcasts to all clients
11. All clients render the new object

### Object Selection Flow:
1. User clicks object with select tool
2. `findObjectAt()` determines clicked object
3. `showSelection()` creates blue selection box
4. Selection box follows object during drag
5. Selection cleared on Escape or clicking empty space

### Object Movement Flow:
1. User selects object
2. User drags object
3. Object position updates in real-time
4. On mouse up, `update_object` event sent to server
5. Server updates database
6. Server broadcasts to all clients
7. All clients update object position

### Object Deletion Flow:
1. Method 1: Delete tool + click object
2. Method 2: Select object + Delete/Backspace key
3. `delete_object` event sent to server
4. Server deletes from database
5. Server broadcasts deletion to all clients
6. All clients remove object from canvas

## Known Limitations

1. Text tool uses browser prompt (could be improved with inline editing)
2. No object resizing handles (future enhancement)
3. No object rotation (future enhancement)
4. No multi-select (future enhancement)
5. No undo/redo (future enhancement)

## Next Steps

This task is complete. The implementation provides:
- Full CRUD operations for canvas objects
- User-friendly keyboard shortcuts
- Visual feedback for all operations
- Multi-user real-time synchronization
- Proper server persistence

Ready to mark Task 15 as done!
